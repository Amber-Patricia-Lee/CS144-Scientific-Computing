# CS144 Scientific Computing
 Final project for Scientific Computing in Summer 2020

I took this course with Professor Darryl Yong at Harvey Mudd College. For my final project, I recreated the results from the paper, Game Theory of Social Distancing in Response to an Epidemic by Timothy Reluga using Python (scipy, numpy).
